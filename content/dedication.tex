\noindent Throughout the writing of my thesis, I have received great support and assistance.
\\

\noindent First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Andreas Polze, whose expertise and systematic methodology were inevitably for this work's structure and success.
\\

\noindent I would further like to acknowledge my tutors Robert Schmid, Lukas Pirl, and Arne Boockmeyer, who supported me with their valuable advice.
Besides all the tools I needed, you gave me indispensable and regular feedback to choose the right direction and successfully complete my thesis.
\\

\noindent I would also like to thank Jakob GÃ¤rtner for his dedication, support, and insights.
Jakob, you not only provided the hardware for the project but also were decisive in formulating the research question.
Without you, this work would not have been possible.
\\

\noindent In addition, I would like to thank my family, friends, and partner.
You were always there for me during a time, where social contacts must be limited to a minimum.
Thank you for every conversation and any welcome distraction.
