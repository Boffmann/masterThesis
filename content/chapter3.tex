In order to be able to provide recommendations for possible fault-tolerant and redundant architectures, as well as mappings to~\gls*{DCPS}-systems, the possible input data, their processing demands, as well as the system's domain need to be known.
Therefore, a example scenario will be introduced in this section by which the reasonings, mappings, and evaluations will be done.
