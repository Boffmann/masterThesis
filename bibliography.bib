  abstract = {At the PODC 2001 conference, I got tired of everyone saying how difficult it was to understand the Paxos algorithm, published in [122]. Although people got so hung up in the pseudo-Greek names that they found the paper hard to understand, the algorithm itself is very simple. So, I cornered a couple of people at the conference and explained the algorithm to them orally, with no paper. When I got home, I wrote down the explanation as a short note, which I later revised based on comments from Fred Schneider and Butler Lampson. The current version is 13 pages long, and contains no formula more complicated than n1 &gt; n2.},

So instead of entering into a discussion of whether safety science is a proper science – whatever that means – the focus will be on whether the notion of safety itself is a proper subject for scientific investigation or indeed whether safety as such is an appropriate topic or subject for a scientific discipline."

abstract = "With the rapid development of communication, control and computer technologies in the last several decades, automatic train operation (ATO), for which the driver no longer has to cautiously operate the control handle, is emerging in many urban rail systems to replace traditional manual driving in recent years. As technology advances in railway systems, one theoretically challenging and practically significant problem is how to use the ATO system to make the current railway network more efficient with higher carrying capacity, lower cost and improved quality of service by optimized railway traffic management and train operation. In this review, we focus on this emerging technology of automatic train operation (ATO) for its theoretical development and practical implementations. Specifically, this study first presents the background of ATO technology in railways, which involves the detailed description of its development and implementation in urban metro systems, fundamental features and basic structure of a typical ATO system. Then, we present a comprehensive literature review in this area, in which the current studies are generally classified into three main aspects, i.e., train operation modeling techniques, train trajectory optimization and train speed control methods. Finally, the emerging requirements for current ATO systems and the most promising research directions in this area in the future are discussed explicitly, including (i) the practical implementation of ATO in main line and high-speed railways, (ii) the cooperative train operation methods for energy-saving issues and (iii) the integration of railway traffic control with advanced ATO technology."
