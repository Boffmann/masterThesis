  abstract = {At the PODC 2001 conference, I got tired of everyone saying how difficult it was to understand the Paxos algorithm, published in [122]. Although people got so hung up in the pseudo-Greek names that they found the paper hard to understand, the algorithm itself is very simple. So, I cornered a couple of people at the conference and explained the algorithm to them orally, with no paper. When I got home, I wrote down the explanation as a short note, which I later revised based on comments from Fred Schneider and Butler Lampson. The current version is 13 pages long, and contains no formula more complicated than n1 &gt; n2.},

abstract = "With the rapid development of communication, control and computer technologies in the last several decades, automatic train operation (ATO), for which the driver no longer has to cautiously operate the control handle, is emerging in many urban rail systems to replace traditional manual driving in recent years. As technology advances in railway systems, one theoretically challenging and practically significant problem is how to use the ATO system to make the current railway network more efficient with higher carrying capacity, lower cost and improved quality of service by optimized railway traffic management and train operation. In this review, we focus on this emerging technology of automatic train operation (ATO) for its theoretical development and practical implementations. Specifically, this study first presents the background of ATO technology in railways, which involves the detailed description of its development and implementation in urban metro systems, fundamental features and basic structure of a typical ATO system. Then, we present a comprehensive literature review in this area, in which the current studies are generally classified into three main aspects, i.e., train operation modeling techniques, train trajectory optimization and train speed control methods. Finally, the emerging requirements for current ATO systems and the most promising research directions in this area in the future are discussed explicitly, including (i) the practical implementation of ATO in main line and high-speed railways, (ii) the cooperative train operation methods for energy-saving issues and (iii) the integration of railway traffic control with advanced ATO technology."

abstract = {Railway track switching provides necessary flexibility to a rail network, but also introduces many single points of failure. Other industries have resorted to redundancy to provide the fault tolerance necessary to achieve specified safety and operational goals in similar critical systems, yet this approach has not yet been applied to track switching. This paper explores several system concepts for redundancy in track switching, and attempts a rudimentary cost/benefit analysis of each. Mechanical design is not considered, the paper being a feasibility study only. Finally, concept performance is evaluated in a case study at Derby Midland station (UK). The results show that providing redundancy which utilises only existing technology demonstrates some gains in operational availability. However, it is unlikely to be cost effective, and for redundancy in track switching to be a realistic prospect, novel designs and technologies may be necessary.}

abstract = {Avionics systems are complex and time-critical systems that are progressively adopting more flexible (though equally robust) architectural designs. Although a number of current avionics systems follow federated architectures, the Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) paradign is becoming the dominant style in the more modern developments. The reason is that the IMA concept promotes modular designs where applications with different levels of criticality can execute in an isolated manner in the same hardware. This approach complies with the requirements of cost, safety, and weight of the avionics systems. FACE standard (Future Airborne Capability Environment) defines the architectural baseline for easing integration in avionics systems, including the communication functions across distributed components. As specified in FACE, middleware will be integrated into avionics systems to ease development of portable components that can interoperate effectively. This paper describes the usage of publish-subscribe middleware (precisely, DDS – Data Distribution Service for real-time systems) into a fully distributed partitioned system. We describe, from a practical point of view, the integration of the middleware communication overhead into the hierarchical scheduling (as compliant with ARINC 653) to allow the usage of middleware in the partitions. We explain the design of a realiable communication setting, exemplified on a distributed monitoring application in a partitioned environment. The obtained implementation results show that, given the stable communication overhead of the middleware, it can be integrated in the time windows of partitions.}
